    <p>
      Lucas is a MSEE from the University of Buenos Aires. He is passionate about
      learning something new and challenging every day. Years ago his interest
      in robotics led him to establish a highly successful Robotics Club at his
      university which is ongoing today, and more recently to work as a researcher
      in the AIS lab, Freiburg. Currently he specialises in path planning software
      for mobile robots. His electronic background, expertise in embedded
      systems (from 8 bit to Embedded Linux) and love for robotics complement
      his devotion to open source software and hardware.

      Besides his work, he enjoys a good movie, theater, music, traveling,
      and the occasional side project which every hacker has :)
